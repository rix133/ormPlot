There were 2 NOTEs, 0 ERRORs and 0 WARNINGs.
On rhub windows-x86_64-devel (r-devel), ubuntu-gcc-release (r-release) and
fedora-clang-devel (r-devel).

The notes are about Licence and maintainer e-mail that are just reminders to 
check those fields. and were not present on local checks. The licence file is
the one provided by github.

## Downstream dependencies
I have not run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of ormPlot.
